                meme, unit of cultural information spread by imitation. The term meme (from the Greek mimema, meaning
                “imitated”) was introduced in 1976 by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his work The
                Selfish Gene.

                Dawkins conceived of memes as the cultural parallel to biological genes and considered them, in a manner
                similar to “selfish” genes, as being in control of their own reproduction and thus serving their own
                ends. Understood in those terms, memes carry information, are replicated, and are transmitted from one
                person to another, and they have the ability to evolve, mutating at random and undergoing natural
                selection, with or without impacts on human fitness (reproduction and survival). The concept of the
                meme, however, remains largely theoretical. It is also controversial, given the notion of selfishness
                and the application of the concept to the evolution of cultures, which formed the basis for the field of
                memetics.

                Within a culture, memes can take a variety of forms, such as an idea, a skill, a behaviour, a phrase, or
                a particular fashion. The replication and transmission of a meme occurs when one person copies a unit of
                cultural information comprising a meme from another person. The process of transmission is carried out
                primarily by means of verbal, visual, or electronic communication, ranging from books and conversation
                to television, e-mail, or the Internet. Those memes that are most successful in being copied and
                transmitted become the most prevalent within a culture.
